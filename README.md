##Welcome to Su Do Art!
See what I did there???
Anyways, this is the first edition of a project I started in quarantine to help expand the boundaries of the my small dungeon of an apartment in Boston, MA.
It's just a script that runs through certain subreddit and grabs new pictures that I think I might like and saves them on my computer. From there, 
they are become my screensaver/background on a rotating basis. To give some creds to the potential original artist, I watermarked the image in the top right
with the username of the one who posted the image. 

##Future Plans
1. Get it back up and running
 -  My local environment is all sorts of messed up so thats priority number one
 -  I think the collector might also be generally broken at the moment
2. Change the algorithm so that it is downloading only pictures I like on reddit rather than ALL of the pictures
3. Incorporate text posts or videos somehow?
4. Make it open source so other people can do the same!
